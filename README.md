# Solved Problems Hub

Welcome to my **Solved Problems Hub**! This repository contains my solutions to various programming challenges across multiple languages, currently including **Java**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**. My goal is to solve 500 problems in total, with 100 problems from each language. So far, I’ve completed 300 problems, and plan to add solutions in **C** and **C++** soon to reach the 500-problem mark.

| C++          | Coming Soon     |

## Structure

Each problem's solution is organized by language, with clear and well-documented code to help understand my approach. Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure in the repository:

- **Java/** - Contains 100 solutions using Java, ranging from beginner to advanced levels.
- **Python/** - Contains 100 Python solutions, covering various topics and algorithms.
- **JavaScript/** - Contains 100 JavaScript solutions, including web-focused challenges and general algorithms.

As I add more solutions, I’ll continue to update the repository and this README.
